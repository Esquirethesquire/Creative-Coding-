# HW-6 Response
## 1. Work Done
This week, I had to create an animated sketch using p5 that also used various math functions. I made a random guy with body parts that spin.
## 2. Steps Taken
I started by reading through the website, and looking at several examples online. I then decided to make a mostly human character.
This week was a lot of testing, I ran into several issues with my code, but troubleshot my way through it all.
## 3. Issues and Questions
I utilized trial and error for the large majority of the project.
