# HW-10 Response
## 1. Work Done
This week, I had to create a sketch that utilized a constructor in another class in some way. I repurposed my sketch from the last week, made it not flash at all, increased the speed of movement, and lowered number of objects.
## 2. Steps Taken
I had already read through this the previous week and created a project that fulfill the requirements, so I re-used it and changed several variables.
## 3. Issues and Questions
I didn't run into any issues with this.
