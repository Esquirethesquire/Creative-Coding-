# HW-4 Response

  ## 1. Work Done
  This week, I had to create a sketch of a monster using p5. I went with a witch, as it was a classic monster.
  ## 2. Steps Taken
  I had to envision what I wanted to create, which was a green skinned witch in robes. After that, I sketched it out on graph paper, and started coding
 ## 3. Issues and Questions
  I utilized trial and error for the large majority of the project, but didn't run into any big issues.

### HW-4 Conclusion

I was late with this assignment and could help no one, and no further discussion needed on this section.
