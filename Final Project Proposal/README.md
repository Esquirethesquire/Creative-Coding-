Final Project Proposal
Proposal: For my final project, I want to create an audio visualizer that looks like paint on a speaker. Most vizulizers are based around bars, but I want to make one that is more of a round concept, and looks like it is pulsing.

Inspirations: I was trying to come up with a final project and the music I was listening to had a very "acid trip" feel to it, and it really called to me. I hope to recreate that feel, and create a sort of paint dripping aesthetic.

Problems / New Things to Learn: For this final project, I will need to learn how to use Audio classes, integrate music into a program, and make the shapes appear to be liquid. I am probably going to run into a lot of issues, but hope to learn a lot in the process.

Work Plan: Wk 1 (21-28) - I plan on finishing research on both visualizers and Audio classes. Wk 2 (29-5) - Work on getting the visualizer to see the sound and change the display based on volume/beat. Start and finish the visual effects and fully integrate song into it. Wk 3 (6-8) - Make last minute touch-ups to the code, fix bugs; correcting any formatting issues and optimizing readability. Submit and turn in all work. 

Current Wk Progress: I am still in the research phase of my project, looking at visualizers and how they function. I have looked into Audio classes, and have formulated some ideas of of that. I plan on doing some testing through the weekend, and then start on my project in full.
