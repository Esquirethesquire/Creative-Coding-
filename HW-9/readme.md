# HW-10 Response
## 1. Work Done
This week, I had to create a sketch that utilized an array  in some way. I made sketch that makes balls that move slightly and the background changes colors every frame.
## 2. Steps Taken
I started by reading through the website, and looking at several examples online.
This week was a lot of testing, I ran into several issues with my code, but troubleshot my way through it all.
## 3. Issues and Questions
I utilized trial and error for the large majority of the project. I read through the site many times to understand arrays, and found some external resources.
